#D-Link DCH-Z110

This app adds support for D-Link DCH-Z110 z-wave device in Homey. 
I only created it for local use, but uploaded it in case someone else was interested. All credit goes to the creators of the Homey Devolo App (https://github.com/athombv/com.devolo), I have merely taken it and adapted it for the D-Link DCH-Z110. Since I was mostly interested in the contact alarm and temperature reading, I have not put any effort in to fixing the Luminescence. If anyone want to fix this, please do so!

###Changelog
Version 1.0.0
- Support added for DCH-Z110. Luminescence not working, but contact alarm and temperature works as intended (I think?).
